## Getting started
If you would like to contribute or use this for any other reason, you can follow the steps below to get the bot up and running.

### Prerequisites
- You need to have created an [application](https://discord.com/developers/applications) in the Discord developer portal, and have access to your client ID and client secret.
- Node 16.18 or newer installed

### Installing the project
1. First pull down the project
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mengidd/RECSIBot.git
   ```

2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install

3. Duplicate the `.env.example` file and name it `.env`. Fill in your client ID and client secret (token) that you got from the Discord developer portal, and provide a guildId (the server ID) for the server we want to run the bot on.

   npm run start
   ```
